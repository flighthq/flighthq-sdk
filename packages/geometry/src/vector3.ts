 * The Vector3Like class represents a point or a location in the three-dimensional space using

 * represents the horizontal axis and the `y` property represents the vertical axis. In
 * three-dimensional space, the `z` property represents depth. The value of the `x` property increases as the object moves to the right. The value of the `y` property
 * increases as the object moves down. The `z` property increases as the object moves
 * farther from the point of view. Using perspective projection and scaling, the object is
 * seen to be bigger when near and smaller when farther away from the screen. As in a
 * right-handed three-dimensional coordinate system, the positive z-axis points away from
 * the viewer and the value of the `z` property increases as the object moves away from the
 * viewer's eye. The origin point (0,0,0) of the global space is the upper-left corner of
 * the stage.
